Done:

[x] Model class
[x] Relu activation function
[x] Generalize data type (instead of forcing vector<float>)


To do (roughly ordered by what we want to do next):

[ ] Name the library

[ ] Read model from JSON/XML/etc.
[ ] Optimizer class (with multi-example training)
[ ] MNIST
[ ] RNN layer
[ ] CNN layer
[ ] Softmax layer



[ ] Find a cool application


[ ] Different types of optimizers (adam, adaboost, etc.)




[ ] Improve performance (caching)
